## Passgen

Passgen is a tool for generating passwords of any length. Moreover, it also allows you to write the password to a file and encrypt or decrypt it whenever needed. It's important to notice that you can only decrypt it using a key generated by the encryption process, which may give the users more security since they can still maintain the files in their machines but hide their keys.

### Prerequisites:

- Git
- Docker or Go

2. Compile it using Docker or Go:
    - Docker:
    
          docker run --rm --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd),target=/app -w /app golang:alpine go build -o passgen cmd/main/main.go
           
    - Go:
    
          go build -o passgen ./cmd/main/main.go
          
3. Run it.


### Examples:

- Generate a password and write it to a file:

      passgen generate -l 23 -f passwords.txt

- Encrypt the content:

      passgen encrypt -f passwords.txt -o passwords_encrypted
      
- Decrypt the content:

      passgen decrypt -f passwords_encrypted.bin -k key
